Azure Percept MM can encrypt AI models before saving them to the device. Each AI model version has its unique key, which is stored in Azure Key Vault. For a client to retrieve the secured key, it needs to authenticate with the Azure Percept MM service using a Service Principal that has been granted reading access to the Key Vault.

The encrypted model files can be embedded into a Docker container or dynamically retrieved through the Azure Percept MM sample code.

> **NOTE:** At the time of writing, Azure Percept MM doesnâ€™t support customer-supplied keys.
